# Hi, I'm Stefan
I like to build things.

## This site

### Purpose
Part blog, part portfolio, part digital laboratory 

### Tech Stack
The site is built with [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), a React framework. I seeded the design from the [Gatsby Strata Starter](https://github.com/rosoftdeveloper/starter-gatsbyjs-strata).

The site is hosted entirely in AWS, as a static website in S3, with Cloudfront in front as a CDN and to enable HTTPS.
